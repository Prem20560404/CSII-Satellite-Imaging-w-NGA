# Computer Science II - Satellite Imaging with NGA
* This is the repository for Satellite Imaging with NGA project of Computer Science II course.
* In this project, I built an Object Detecting Program in Python using the Mask R-CNN model, Scikit-learn, Keras, and Tensorflow.
* I used COCO dataset and custom dataset in JSON format created using VGG Annotator, trained the Mask R-CNN model on the custom dataset, and tested the model with a minimum confidence of 70 percent.
